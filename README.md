# Random number generation and data visualization

One example of simple data visualization and random number generation can be found in this repository (plotting). The following libraries are required to run these programs:

* rcParams
* numpy
* matplotlib (Python)

These require a functional Python distribution with the Python packages numpy and latex additionally installed (so that the python executable exists).
