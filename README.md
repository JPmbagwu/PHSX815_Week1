# Random number generation and data visualization

One example of simple data visualization and random number generation can be found in this repository (plotting). One plotting library was used; setup and installation instructions can be found at the sites below. Users must independently download and setup this library.

* matplotlib (Python)


# Example usage

matplotlib (Python)
The python file python/Random_python.py can be run from the command line by typing:

<> python python/Random_python.py

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package numpy also installed.
