# Random number generation and data visualization

One example of simple data visualization and random number generation can be found in this repository (plotting). The following libraries are required to run these programs:

* rcParams
* numpy
* matplotlib (Python)

# Example usage
matplotlib (Python) The python file python/Random_python.py can be run from the command line by typing:

<> python python/Random_python.py

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package numpy and latex also installed.
