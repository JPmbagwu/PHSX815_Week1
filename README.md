# Random number generation and data visualization

This repository contains an illustration of basic data visualization and random number generating (plotting). Running these programs requires the following libraries:

* rcParams
* numpy
* matplotlib (Python)

These require a functional Python distribution with the Python packages numpy and latex additionally installed (so that the python executable exists).
